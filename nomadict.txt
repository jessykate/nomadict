This is the Nomadic Rhizomatic dictionary. It is full of fashionable lingo in
the crtical theory community. It is kind of serious, in as much as these terms
are used and it's nice to have a reference for where they come from and they
mean. But it's also kind of taking the piss, because we all become a bit of a
stereotype sometimes.

:nomos: "`Nomos' is the name that Deleuze gives to the way of arranging
elements whether they are people, thoughts or space itself - that does not rely
upon an organisation or permanent structure. It indicates a free distribution,
rather than structured organisation, of certain elements." <a href="http://deleuze.enacademic.com/117">ref</a>

:striated: A partitioned field of movement which prohibits free motion. "One of
the fundamental tasks of the State is to striate the space over which it
reigns," (D&G 385). "the State" operates through the capture of movement and
the partition of space. Similarly, the State is also concerned with striating
space or building into it a hierarchical system of relations... "Smooth space"
exists in contrast to "striated space."

:nomad: "Nomadism" is a way of life that exists outside of the organizational
"State." The nomadic way of life is characterized by movement across space
which exists in sharp contrast to the rigid and static boundaries of the State
<a href="http://www.rhizomes.net/issue5/poke/glossary.html">ref</a>

:urstaat: The always and ever existing State. "For Deleuze there has always
been a State — the Urstaat, an eternal State which comes into existence fully
formed, at one stroke (Deleuze and Guattari 1988:437). This non-economic
analysis of the State opens up a radical philosophical terrain in which power
is theorised in its own right." <a href="https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/saul-newman-war-on-the-state-stirner-and-deleuze-s-anarchism">ref.</a>
